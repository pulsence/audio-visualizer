# Todo:
## General
- Make the UI and render/visualizers clearly decumpled so that the render path can be used as a separate library
## GUI
- Clicking on color swatches should open color dialogue
- Chroma gradients should follow tabs like the chroma lines view
## Visualizers
- Set video dimensions by number of objects in visualizer
- Future visualizers:
    - Cloud/Particles
    - Ring
